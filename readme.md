# Project 15: BMI Calculator (C1 SoftDev Program)

This project is a part of the C1 SoftDev program, specifically Project 15. The main goal of this project was to showcase our understanding of the various frameworks we were introduced to during the course.

## Project Overview

The project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The app allows the user to input their weight (in pounds) and height (in centimeters), and it calculates the BMI based on these inputs. It also categorizes the BMI into 'Underweight', 'Normal weight', 'Overweight', and 'Obese'.

## Core Features

-   **BMI Calculation**: The app calculates the BMI based on the user's input weight and height.
-   **BMI Categorization**: The calculated BMI is categorized into 'Underweight', 'Normal weight', 'Overweight', and 'Obese'.
-   **React Hooks**: This project makes extensive use of React Hooks, including useState and useEffect, to manage state and side effects. `useEffect` is used to calculate BMI whenever the weight or height state variables change, ensuring that the BMI is always up-to-date with the latest weight and height values.
-   **Semantic HTML**: The app is built with semantic HTML tags, which help to improve accessibility and make the code easier to understand. Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` are used to structure the content in a meaningful way.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: The app is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable designs.
-   **Vite**: This project was bootstrapped with Vite, a build tool that significantly improves development speed by offering fast cold server start, instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR), and true on-demand compilation.
-   **ESLint and Prettier**: ESLint is used for linting the codebase to catch bugs and enforce a consistent code style. Prettier is used for code formatting. The project extends WesBos' ESLint configuration for an opinionated, standardized setup.
